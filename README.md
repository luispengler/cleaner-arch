# cleaningarch
## This repository was created to help you clean your arch, or arch based distro. Please read the code line first. ##
## I've used vim as the text editor, but since you download the .sh file you will only need to run it with: ##
bash cleaning.sh

## Also, you also need some internet conection to run the first line, which would be: ##
sudo pacman -Syy

## Any problem you have, just tell me and help me improve. This is my first project here ;) ##
