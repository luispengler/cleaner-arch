# Introduction
 
 This repository was created to help you clean your arch, or arch based distro. Please read the code line first.
 I've used vim as the text editor, but since you download the .sh file you will only need to run it with: 
 
 # Code
    bash cleaning.sh


Any problem you have, just tell me and help me improve. This is my first project here ;)
